# ITP Week 2 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice 3

# Functions Parameters and Arguments

# Lets take those functions we built in practice_2 and make them more dynamic:

# Rewrite the functions from practice_2 using parameters:
# add_num
def add_num(x,y):
    print(x+y)
# subtract_num
def subtract_num(x,y):
    print(x-y)
# multiply_num
def multiply_num(x,y):
    print(x*y)
# divide_num
def divide_num(x,y):
    print(x/y)
# Don't forget to call your functions to make sure they work
#Uncomment to call your functions:
# print("I should see the number 7 below from add_num: ")
print("I should see the number 7 below from add_num: ")
# add_num(3, 4)
add_num(3,4)
# print("I should see the number -2 below from subtract_num: ")
print("I should see the number -2 below from subtract_num: ")
# subtract_num(6, 8)
subtract_num(6,8)
# print("I should see the number 18 below from multiply_num: ")
print("I should see the number 18 below from multiply_num: ")
# multiply_num(2, 9)
multiply_num(2,9)
# print("I should see the number 2 below from divide_num: ")
print("I should see the number 2 below from divide_num: ")
# divide_num(10, 5)
divide_num(10,5)
# Extra Time?

# Now take in 2 users inputs and pass them 
# in as arguments when calling the functions
